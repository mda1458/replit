# Step-by-Step GitHub Upload Guide (2025 Interface)

## Current GitHub Interface Navigation

### Method 1: Upload Files Button (Most Common)

1. **Go to your repository**: `https://github.com/yourusername/forgiveness-journey`
2. **Look for the main repository page** with the file list
3. **Find the "Add file" button** (usually green or blue, near the top right of the file list)
4. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**

### Method 2: If Repository is Empty

If your repository is completely empty (no README):
1. You'll see a quick setup page
2. Look for **"uploading an existing file"** text link
3. OR click **"choose your files"** button

### Method 3: Drag and Drop Area

1. Look for a **dotted border area** that says "Drag files here to add them to your repository"
2. You can drag entire folders directly into this area

## Where to Find Upload Options

**Look for these elements on your GitHub repo page:**

```
Repository Header:
[forgiveness-journey] [Watch] [Star] [Fork]

File Navigation Area:
[Code ▼] [Add file ▼] [<> Code] [Issues] [Pull requests]
              ↑
         Click here!
```

**The "Add file" dropdown contains:**
- Create new file
- **Upload files** ← Click this one

## Upload Process

### Step 1: Access Upload
1. Navigate to your repo
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**

### Step 2: Select Files
**Option A - Individual Files:**
- Click "choose your files"
- Select multiple files (Ctrl+click or Cmd+click)

**Option B - Drag Folders:**
- Open your project folder on your computer
- Drag the entire `client/` folder to GitHub
- Repeat for `server/`, `shared/` folders
- Add configuration files individually

### Step 3: Commit Changes
- **Commit message**: `Initial commit: Forgiveness Journey v2025.01.19.v3`
- **Description**: `Complete wellness application with privacy features and mobile design`
- Click **"Commit changes"**

## Alternative Method: GitHub Desktop

If web upload doesn't work:
1. Download **GitHub Desktop** app
2. Clone your empty repository
3. Copy your files into the local folder
4. Commit and push through the app

## Troubleshooting

**If you can't find upload options:**
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check if you have write permissions to the repo
- Try using a different browser

**If upload fails:**
- File might be too large (GitHub has 100MB limit)
- Try uploading folders separately
- Ensure file names don't have special characters

## File Size Considerations

GitHub limits:
- **Individual files**: 100MB max
- **Repository**: 1GB recommended
- **Your project**: ~50MB (well within limits)

## Expected Result

After successful upload, your repository will show:
- Complete file structure
- Green commit indicators
- All your source code files
- Ready for deployment to any platform

**Next step after upload**: You can deploy directly from GitHub to Railway, Vercel, or other platforms!
