## Option 2: Hire a Developer for 1 Hour

## Option 3: Railway Direct Deploy (Skip GitHub)

## Option 4: Static Site Deployment (Easiest)

### What to Include:

- "Happy to pay for quick help"

## My Recommendation: Option 1 (GoDaddy Direct)

**Why**: You already have the domain and hosting, just upload the essential files:

### Minimal Upload for GoDaddy:
1. **Take your `client` folder**
2. **Upload just the built files** (from `dist/public` if you kept it)
3. **Skip all server complexity** for now
4. **Get your enhanced design live on forgiveness.info**

This gets your beautiful v2025.01.19.v3 design with the enhanced hero, journey buttons, and privacy features live immediately without any GitHub complexity.
