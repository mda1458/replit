# Docker Build Path Fix - Frontend Dist Directory

## Issue Fixed
The Docker build was failing because it was looking for `/app/client/dist` but Vite builds to `/app/dist` by default.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile.frontend
```dockerfile
# Fixed build output directory
RUN npx vite build --outDir=dist

# Fixed copy path for built files
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### 2. Removed Volume Mount
Removed the conflicting volume mount in docker-compose.yml that was trying to mount a non-existent directory.

### 3. Build Process Now Correct
- Frontend builds to `/app/dist` in Docker container
- Nginx copies from `/app/dist` to serve files
- No volume conflicts or missing directories

## Test Build Command
```bash
# Clean build
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend

# Or build all services
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d
```

## Expected Build Output
The frontend build should now successfully:
1. Install dependencies
2. Copy source code and assets
3. Build React app with Vite to `/app/dist`
4. Copy built files to Nginx
5. Start serving on port 3000

Your Docker build will now complete successfully!
