# Deploy Forgiveness Journey to forgiveness.info (GoDaddy)

## Deployment Strategy

Since you have **forgiveness.info** and **forgiveness.world** on GoDaddy, I recommend deploying using the **hybrid approach** that works best with GoDaddy shared hosting:

### **Option A: Frontend + External Backend (Recommended)**
- Deploy React frontend to GoDaddy shared hosting (forgiveness.info)
- Use Railway/Vercel for Node.js backend API
- Point API calls to external backend service

### **Option B: Static Site + Serverless Functions**
- Build React app as static site for GoDaddy
- Use Netlify Functions or Vercel Edge Functions for backend logic
- Simple and reliable for shared hosting

### **Option C: Full Migration to Modern Hosting**
- Use forgiveness.info domain with Railway/Vercel
- Point DNS to new hosting provider
- Keep GoDaddy for domain management only

## Recommended Approach: Option A (Hybrid)

This gives you immediate deployment while maintaining your domains and ensuring all v2025.01.19.v3 features work perfectly.

### Step 1: Build Frontend for Static Deployment

```bash
# In your Replit environment
npm run build
```

This creates `/dist/public/` with all your React app files.

### Step 2: Deploy to GoDaddy

**Upload Process:**
1. Access GoDaddy cPanel File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. Upload all contents from `/dist/public/` folder
4. Create `.htaccess` file for React routing

### Step 3: Backend API (Railway)

Deploy your Express server to Railway for the API endpoints, then update your React app to point to the Railway API URL.

## Immediate Action Plan

**Would you prefer:**

1. **Quick Static Deployment** (15 minutes)
   - Deploy just the frontend to forgiveness.info
   - Use external APIs for backend features
   - Get your enhanced v3 design live immediately

2. **Full Hybrid Setup** (1-2 hours)
   - Frontend on GoDaddy
   - Backend on Railway
   - Complete functionality with your domains

3. **Modern Hosting Migration** (2-3 hours)
   - Use Railway/Vercel with forgiveness.info domain
   - Full stack deployment
   - Better performance and features
