# Replit Support Request - Deployment Pipeline Issue

## Issue Summary
**Project**: task0track-pro  
**Problem**: Deployment pipeline serving outdated version despite successful builds  
**Impact**: Production sites not reflecting latest code changes  

## Technical Details

### Project Information:
- **Repl Name**: task0track-pro
- **Custom Domain**: forgivenessjourney.app  
- **Framework**: Node.js/Express + React/Vite
- **Deployment Type**: Autoscale

### Issue Description:
The deployment system appears to be stuck serving version v2025.01.19.v2 despite multiple successful deployments of version v2025.01.19.v3. The development environment correctly shows the latest version, but all deployed endpoints continue serving the old version.

### Affected URLs:
- https://task0track-pro.replit.app
- https://forgivenessjourney.app
- Mobile app (all devices)

### Evidence of Issue:

#### ✅ Development Environment (Working):
- Shows version v2025.01.19.v3
- All enhanced features visible
- Privacy policy checkboxes functional
- AI consent modal working
- Enhanced hero section displaying

#### ❌ Production Deployment (Issue):
- Only shows version v2025.01.19.v2
- Missing enhanced features
- Missing privacy components
- Missing UI improvements

### Technical Investigation Completed:

#### Build Configuration ✅
- Production build successful: `npm run build`
- Assets properly generated in `/dist/public/`
- Version v2025.01.19.v3 confirmed in built HTML
- Deploy ID added for cache busting: `1752938761`

#### Environment Configuration ✅
- `.env.production` updated to `VITE_APP_VERSION=2025.01.19.v3`
- Build process working correctly
- No build errors in console output

#### Deployment Configuration ✅
- `.replit` file properly configured:
  ```
  [deployment]
  deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
  build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
  run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
  ```

### Troubleshooting Steps Attempted:
1. Multiple fresh deployments via Deploy button
2. Clean rebuilds with `rm -rf dist/ && npm run build`
3. Environment variable updates
4. Cache busting with unique deploy IDs
5. Server logging for version verification
6. HTML modifications to force updates

### Request for Support:
The issue appears to be in Replit's deployment pipeline not serving the latest build artifacts. Despite successful builds containing version v3, the deployed sites continue serving cached version v2.

**Requested Actions:**
1. Investigate deployment caching mechanism
2. Force refresh of deployment assets
3. Verify build artifacts are properly deployed
4. Clear any cached versions preventing updates
