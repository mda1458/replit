Subject: URGENT - Deployment Pipeline Issue (task0track-pro)

Hello Replit Support,

I'm experiencing a critical deployment issue where my production app is stuck serving an outdated version despite successful builds.

Project: task0track-pro
Issue: Deployment serves v2025.01.19.v2 instead of built v2025.01.19.v3
Impact: Wellness application with privacy compliance features blocked

Technical Details:
- Development: Shows correct v3 with all features
- Production Build: Successfully contains v3 in /dist/public/index.html  
- Deployed Sites: Still serving v2 on all endpoints
- Attempts: Multiple deployments, cache busting, clean rebuilds

This appears to be a deployment pipeline caching issue. Can you please investigate and force refresh the deployment assets?

Affected URLs:
- task0track-pro.replit.app
- forgivenessjourney.app

Priority: High (production application serving users)

Thank you for your urgent assistance.
