# How to Give Freelancer Access to Your Replit Project

## Method 1: Replit Multiplayer (Safest)

### Steps:
1. **In your Replit project**, look for the "Share" button (top right corner)
2. **Click "Share"** → **"Invite people"**
3. **Enter freelancer's email address**
4. **Set permission level**: "Can edit" (they need to copy all files)
5. **Set time limit**: 1 week (you can revoke access anytime)
6. **Send invitation**

### What This Gives Them:
- Full access to view and copy all your code
- Ability to see your file structure
- Can download/export your project
- Cannot delete or permanently damage your project
- You maintain full control and can revoke access

## Method 2: Public Fork (Alternative)

### Steps:
1. **Make your Replit temporarily public**:
   - Click Settings → Visibility → Public
2. **Share the public link** with freelancer
3. **They can fork it** to their own account
4. **Make your project private again** after they start

### Advantage:
- No email invitation needed
- They get their own copy to work with
- Your original stays untouched

## What to Share with Freelancer
