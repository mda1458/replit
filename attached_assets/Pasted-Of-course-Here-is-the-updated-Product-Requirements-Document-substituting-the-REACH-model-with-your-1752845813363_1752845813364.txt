4.2 Expanded Module Descriptions
•	(S) - Sustain the gratitude of release: This module focuses on shifting the user's perspective from the past pain to the present peace they have cultivated. Gratitude is framed as an active practice to maintain the benefits of forgiveness. Through guided journaling and meditations, users will learn to appreciate their own strength and the newfound emotional lightness. The goal is to consciously acknowledge the positive state achieved, reinforcing the neural pathways associated with peace and wellbeing. This practice helps prevent a relapse into old patterns of resentment by actively filling the emotional space with appreciation for the freedom that has been claimed. It is the crucial step of watering the seeds of peace that were planted during the journey.
•	(E) - Enjoy the freedom of forgiveness: This final module solidifies the emotional rewards of the journey. It’s not just about ending a negative state, but actively beginning a positive one. Users are guided to consciously enjoy their freedom from rumination, bitterness, and the mental energy drain that unforgiveness causes. This step encourages them to maintain a new, positive emotional state regarding the subject, mindfully choosing peace whenever old memories surface. Activities in this module focus on presence, helping users to fully inhabit their lives without the shadow of the past. It’s about answering "What now?" by filling the space once occupied by hurt with peace, purpose, and the simple joy of being emotionally free.
