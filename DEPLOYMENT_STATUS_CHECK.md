# DEPLOYMENT STATUS & TROUBLESHOOTING

## Current Deployment Issue

### Problem:
- Version v2025.01.19.v3 with enhanced features not appearing on deployed sites
- Only old version v2 is showing on:
  - task0track-pro.replit.app
  - forgivenessjourney.app
  - Mobile iPhone 16 Pro

### Root Cause Analysis:

#### 1. Production Environment Configuration ✅
- `.env.production` updated to v3 ✅
- Build process working correctly ✅
- Assets compiled with latest components ✅

#### 2. Deployment Configuration Check
Let's verify the deployment setup:

**Current .replit configuration:**
```
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

**Potential Issues:**
- Replit deployment may be using cached assets
- Build process might not be triggering properly
- Environment variables not propagating correctly

### Deployment Troubleshooting Steps

#### Step 1: Force Complete Rebuild
1. Clean all build artifacts: `rm -rf dist/`
2. Fresh production build: `npm run build`
3. Verify v3 in built HTML: Check `dist/public/index.html`

#### Step 2: Cache Busting Applied
- Updated Deploy ID to: `1752938761`
- Added server console log for version tracking
- Modified HTML comments for deployment verification

#### Step 3: Alternative Deployment Strategy

If standard deployment continues failing, try:

**Option A: Manual Deployment Verification**
1. Check Replit deployment logs for build errors
2. Verify environment variables in deployment settings
3. Confirm build artifacts are being properly copied

**Option B: Force New Deployment**
1. Delete existing deployment (if possible)
2. Create fresh deployment with new configuration
3. Verify all environment secrets are properly set

#### Step 4: Development vs Production Verification

**Development Environment (working):**
- Shows v3 with all enhanced features
- Privacy checkboxes working
- AI consent modal functioning
- Enhanced hero section displaying

**Production Environment (issue):**
- Only showing v2
- Missing enhanced features
- Missing privacy components

This suggests a deployment pipeline issue rather than code problem.

### Next Actions Required

1. **Immediate:** Deploy with current configuration
2. **Verify:** Check deployment logs for any build failures
3. **Test:** Confirm if new Deploy ID appears in deployed HTML
4. **Escalate:** If issue persists, may need Replit support for deployment pipeline

### Expected Resolution

Once deployment pipeline issue is resolved, all sites should show:
- Version v2025.01.19.v3 in page source
- Purple gradient hero section
- "Click Here" buttons on journey panels
- Privacy policy checkboxes
- AI consent modal functionality

The code is ready - this appears to be a deployment infrastructure issue.
